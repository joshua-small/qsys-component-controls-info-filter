# Component Controls Info Filter

Filters Component Controls Info by control name and type without changing the source controls. This passive mod operates inside its native editor; it has no empty operation window or preferences page.

Requires [Q-SYS Mods Core](https://github.com/joshua-small/qsys-mods-core) 0.1.x, Q-SYS Mod Manager 0.8+, and the exact supported Designer 10.5 build. Use the manager migration to avoid duplicate hooks. Better Shortcuts is optional.

Clone Core beside this repository. Build Designer.Modules.ComponentControlsInfoFilter.csproj with .NET 10.0.112 and local DesignerDir references. Vendor assemblies remain local. The feature is extracted from Schematic Tools commit 13c52e6 with shared host access routed through Core; the split passes compilation and isolated-host startup. No new hardware support is claimed.
